<h1>Creating Virtual Machine (Azure)</h1>
This tutorial outlines the process of creating Azure Virtual Machines. Virtual Machines are software-based creations of a physical computer. They can be created and used for multiple reasons from, disaster recovery, and training to my favorite, sandboxing. <br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)

First you want to choose the correct subscription and the correct resourse group for this virtual machine. Today I will be using the resource group previously created "coursecareerlabs". Then choose the Virtual Machine Name you would like to use. After that choose the correct region, in this case I will be choosing East US 2 since I am on the east coast.

</p>
<p>
Choose a good and memorable username and password for this virtual machine, as well as selecting RDP for imbound ports so you can remote access the VM.

</p>
<p>
Also make sure that the licensing box is checked as it is needed to move on to the next step.

</p>
<p>
If you haven't already you will need to create a virtual network which I already have and it is called "lab2-vnet" so that is what i'll be using. Next Hit Review + Create and create your virtual machine.

<p>
It will take sometime but once you're finished your screen should look like this and you should be able to use your virtual machine.
